         <h2>Static Website</h2>
         <p>This project was for an auto detailing company in Hawaii. The company needed a very simple website to display contact information and services. The colors they preferred were white and black. </p>
         <h2>Goals</h2>
         <p>My objective was to only used HTML and CSS as to not be distracted by JavaScript. </p>
         <h2>Reflections</h2>
         <p> Among the biggest challenges was learning how to take technologies learned in lessons and translating them into an actual project. This meant that a lot of time was spent reading blogs posts, scanning stack overflow, and reviewing course previously taken, to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS. <br><br> The value of planning was made apperent looking back. Skectching wireframes for the entire website for all views may have taken some time, but the time lost because of disorganization was much greater <br><br> Making a point to not use JavaScript was a mistake as JavaScript is best suited for interaction. br Eventually I did use jQuery for an accordion like drop down menu on the services tab. <br><br> It was made obvious that I needed to organize my CSS file  and provide better class names for future projects. Also, the importance of a grid frame work was also made apparent. <br><br> Another area for improvment was graphic design. While the web site was functional it seemed to be lacking originality and order.</p>
         <h2>How to Interact</h2>
         <p>This is  a standard website taht is fully responsive. If on a phone or tablet, switch from portrait view and landscape mode to see changes in layout. If you are using a desktop, shrink and expand your browser to see the different layouts.</p>

            <h2>*Aside</h2>
            <p>After improving my graphic design skills I will come back to this project and redesign the website with my new insight. My own website drew inspiration from this project and refined some of the features used in this project. </p>
