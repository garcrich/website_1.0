                     <p>After I graduated college I has to face the cold hard truth, I didn’t have skills that produced tangible results. <br><br>Having this realization shook me to the core. I believed in the American dream, work hard, go college and you will have a great life. This wasn’t the case. <br><br>I was fortunate enough to get a job at a credit union providing online support for customers. <br><br>At my new job I was faced with many mundane challenges that I had to perform on a daily basis. <br><br>I found myself constantly clicking, waiting, and typing the same thing over and over. For my own sanity I had to find a better way to complete my work.</p>

                     <h2>Learning to Learn</h2>
                     <p>It was at this point that I decided to learn Microsoft Office deeply. <br><br> I used the Microsoft suite every day and the majority of my tasks were completed with these programs. <br><br>I found search the web for resources, read countless books, found forums, and watched online tutorials.<br><br>Eventually I because a certified Microsoft Office Specialist and became the expert within my company. I helped solved problems ranging from setting up templates for emails, reformatting Frequently Asked Question form, fixing PowerPoint presentations, and much more. <br><br>This knew found knowledge was powerful, and I was able to learn this on my own. </p>

                     <h2>Mastering Learning</h2>
                     <p>I had always wanted to try my hand in graphic design so I learned the basics, form, typography, drawing, color, graphic design software. <br><br>Over the course a year I found myself enjoying creating a few things here and there but never digging too deep.<br><br>I got rejected, again, and again… and again.<br><br> Being tired of my entry level job which I was over qualified for I applied for positions as a Marketer and a Technical Writer. <br><br>Every time I was asked the question, “Do you know HTML?” Well, I guess. About the only thing I knew about HTML was that it was the backbone of the web. </p>
                     <p>After being underqualified I decided to learn HTML, with HTML came another language CSS, and with this came JavaScript, and the technologies kept coming.<br><br> From writing a basic page that simple said, “Hello world!” to the web page you see today I made a conscious effort to always improve. <br><br>The most important lesson I’ve ever learned is, never stopped learning, and I never will.</p>
