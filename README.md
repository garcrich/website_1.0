Wireframes were then made in CorelDraw, a graphic design program.

##4. Gathering Assets
The img folder was created and each asset was placed in appropriate folder.

##5. Creating a Mockup
One mock-up was made to capture the feel of the website. Color scheme was also set here.

##6. Code Website
Coded features starting with header and footer. The some designs changed to improve aesthetics. CSS was made to be as reusable as possible. DRY coding was also taken into consideration as much as possible. The blog page changed to YouTube content due to the limitations of hosting on GitHub as well as time constraints.
